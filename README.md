# Introduction to jQuery
- jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
- jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today.
- jQuery is free, open-source software liscensed under the MIT license.
- jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations,
handle events, and develop AJAX applications.
- jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plugins on top of the JavaScript library.
- This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects, and high-level,
theme-able widgets.
- The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications.
- The set of jQuery features - DOM element selections, traversal and manipulation - enabled by the selector engine, created
a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures.
- Microsoft and Nokia bundle jQuery on their platforms. Microsoft bundles it with Visual Studio for use within Microsoft's
ASP.NET AJAX framework and ASP.NET MVC FRamework while Nokia has integrated it into the Web Run-Time widget development
platform.

#jQuery Overview
- jQuery at its core is a DOM (document object model) manipulation library.
- The DOM is a tree-structure manipulation of all the elements of a webpage and jQuery makes finding, selecting, and 
manipulating these DOM elements simple and convenient.
